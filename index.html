							<h1>Alex Radford</h1>
							<p>Hello there and welcome to my portfolio. On this website are projects that I have worked on as a game developer and as musician . All the assets are created by myself and produced on a smaller scale so that I can show different genres and creativity.</p>

									<h2>Pong</h2>
									<p>The infamous game had to have been made as it was part of my foray into effective game design. I recreated the title with no major changes and provided a learning experience to 2d physics and CPU design.</p>

									<h2>Text-Based Adventure</h2>
									<p>My favourite of game genres! I just had to create a text based adventure. Although the code behind this project is a bit overkill I wanted to be able to demonstrate my writing abilities both coding and creative.</p>

									<h2>Match 3</h2>
									<p>My match 3 game Veggies showcases my ability to create projects for different audiences. As for a few years these types of games held a large demographic and gained high economic value I felt it an ideal learning experience to think of a different audience than myself.</p>

							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>The small points below are to inform you of my strong skill sets with detail and information about how and why I am a multi-faceted game designer.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Whilst at University I attended lectures on computer science which further drew me into game design. After graduating I proceeded to delve deeper into software development with an apprenticeship focusing on studying C# alongside working on a cross-platform mobile project.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-paint-brush"></span>
									<h3>2d Art</h3>
									<p> After taking a break from University I focused on my hobbies,  leading myself to creative opportunities. I developed a love of art and drawing, attending life drawing classes and engaging myself in both vector, painting, and concept art.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cubes"></span>
									<h3>3d Art</h3>
									<p> For a year in my college education I studied Computer games development. It largely focused on the fundamentals of 3d art. This sparked a massive interest in games development that is a passion of mine and something I am determined to be part of. Because of this I have gained skills in modelling, soft surface and hard. As well as texturing, rigging and animating.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-headphones"></span>
									<h3>Music and Sound</h3>
									<p> After my College education I took a step away from the 3d aspects and began focusing on music and sound. I felt that the course wouldn't lead to the best route into game design and I decided that an academic education would better my chances at breaking into the industry than a vocational one.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-book"></span>
									<h3>Writing</h3>
									<p>At University I took part in the Drama Society performing in plays and engaging in many elements of performance. Whilst doing this an opportunity arose in which I wrote a comedic play that won best writing of that year.</p>
								</section>
                                	<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Game Design</h3>
									<p>I enjoy the creative side of game design as well as the puzzle solving elements of development. All combined with an unending passion for games. I engage in both board games and video and have a guilty pleasure of D and D. Above all of this is a passion for making the best games that can inspire players to learn, develop and have a good chuckle with.</p>
