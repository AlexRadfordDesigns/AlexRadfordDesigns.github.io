									<h2>Pong</h2>
									<p>The infamous game had to have been made as it was part of my foray into effective game design. I recreated the title with no major changes, but it provided a learning experience to 2d physics.</p>

									<h2>Text-Based Adventure</h2>
									<p>My favourite of game genres! I just had to create a text based adventure. Although the code behind this project is a bit overkill I wanted to be able to demonstrate my writing ability and coding standards.</p>

									<h2>Match-3</h2>
									<p>This match 3 game is here to showcase my ability to create projects for different audiences. As for a few years these types of games held a large demographic and gained high economic value I felt it necessary to create such a project.</p>

									<h2>FPS Platformer</h2>
									<p>As most fps are now implementing more complex movement and intuitive gameplay I wanted to create a high impact game to show my skills at 3d calculations and physic understanding whilst also having a fun game that shows common trends.</p>

									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>During my studies at university I attended lectures on computer science which further drew me into game design. After graduating I proceeded to delve deeper into software development with an apprenticeship focusing on studying c# alongside working on a cross-platform mobile project.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-paint-brush"></span>
									<h3>2d Art</h3>
									<p>Whilst taking a break from university I focused on hobbies and what I enjoyed, again leading myself to creative opportunities. I began to find a love of art and drawing attending life drawing classes and engaging myself in both vector, painting, and concept drawing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cubes"></span>
									<h3>3d Art</h3>
									<p> For a year in my college education I studied Computer games development. It largely focused on the fundamentals of 3d art. From this developed a massive hobby that is a passion of mine. From the study I have gained skills in modelling, soft surface and hard. As well as texturing, rigging and animating.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-headphones"></span>
									<h3>Music and Sound</h3>
									<p> After my college education I took a step away from the 3d aspects and began focusing on music and sound. The reason was that I felt that the course that I was on wouldn't be the best route into game design and I felt an academic education would better my chances at breaking into the industry than a vocational one.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Game Design</h3>
									<p>Finally with all this combined has developed my skills into game design. Not only do I enjoy the creative processes but I have an unending passion for games, I engage in both board games and video. With a guilty pleasure of D and D enjoying the imagination and comradary that it provides</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-book"></span>
									<h3>Writing</h3>
									<p>Whilst at university I engaged within the drama society of my university performing in plays and engaging in many elements of performance. Whilst doing this an opportunity arose in which I wrote a comedic play that won best of that year.</p>
